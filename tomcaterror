To remove Apache Tomcat from a Linux system, you'll need to uninstall the Tomcat package and delete any remaining directories associated with the installation. The specific steps may vary slightly depending on how you installed Tomcat and your Linux distribution. Here's a general approach:

1. **Stop Tomcat**: Before uninstalling Tomcat, make sure it's not running. You can stop Tomcat using the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop tomcat9
   ```

   Replace `tomcat9` with the appropriate service name if you're using a different version of Tomcat.

2. **Uninstall the Tomcat package**: If you installed Tomcat using your distribution's package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `zypper`), you can uninstall it using the corresponding command. For example, on Ubuntu/Debian:

   ```bash
   sudo apt remove tomcat9
   ```

   Replace `tomcat9` with the appropriate package name if you're using a different version of Tomcat or a different Linux distribution.

3. **Remove Tomcat directories**: After uninstalling the package, you may want to delete any remaining directories associated with Tomcat. Common directories include:

   - `/var/lib/tomcat9`: This directory typically contains the Tomcat installation files, web applications, and temporary files.
   - `/etc/tomcat9`: Configuration files for Tomcat.
   - `/usr/share/tomcat9`: Additional files used by Tomcat.
   - `/var/log/tomcat9`: Log files for Tomcat.

   You can delete these directories using the `rm` command:

   ```bash
   sudo rm -rf /var/lib/tomcat9
   sudo rm -rf /etc/tomcat9
   sudo rm -rf /usr/share/tomcat9
   sudo rm -rf /var/log/tomcat9
   ```

   Be cautious when using the `rm` command with the `-rf` option, as it will recursively delete directories and their contents without prompting for confirmation.

4. **Remove Tomcat user**: Some distributions create a dedicated user for running Tomcat. If your distribution does this, you can remove the Tomcat user using the `userdel` command:

   ```bash
   sudo userdel tomcat
   ```

   Replace `tomcat` with the actual username if it's different on your system.

After completing these steps, Apache Tomcat should be fully removed from your Linux system.
